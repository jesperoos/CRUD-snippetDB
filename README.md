# CRUD-snippetDB  
***Installing***  
Copy the repository clone link and open git bash in the folder where you want the application. Write git clone + paste link. Write cd b2-crud to navigate into folder. Here you write npm install to install the libraries used with node.  
Open docker, and open a gitbash window inside b2-crud. Write docker-compose up and then minimize terminal. Open another git bash terminal in b2-crud and write npm start, then minimize terminal.  
Open google chrome and write localhost:3000 in the url field. Use website.

***Admin***  
The first account you create will have the role of admin. This account has access to more things on the website than the normal user accounts. I could have expanded this a bit more and made it so that admins can remove/update snippets from all users, but as of now they have the extra possibility of deleting all users and all snippets. And also to list all users.  

***
***User***  
All accounts created after the first one will have the role user. These accounts have the ability to list all snippets, create a snippet, delete a snippet that he/she has created, and update a snippet that he/she has created.  
If you don't sign in to the website, you can only view the created snippets.
